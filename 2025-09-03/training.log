Overview:
Today's focus was on refining web scraping techniques using Regex and XPath, with practical application on a real-world e-commerce website. The session involved cleaning previous tasks, writing precise XPaths for complex page structures, and extracting detailed product information.

Task Optimization:
Updated previous data cleaning tasks using Regex for text processing and XPath for structured data extraction.

Daily Meeting:
Discussed progress on the ongoing project, clarified doubts, and reviewed challenges faced during XPath development.

New Task Assigned:
Write XPaths to scrape data from Marks & Spencer (UK):

- PLP (Product Listing Page):
- Scrape PDP (Product Detail Page) URLs.
- Extract pagination links.
- Capture category names.

PDP (Product Detail Page):
Extract the following fields using XPath:

- unique_id
- product_name
- brand
- category
- regular_price
- selling_price
- promotion_description
- breadcrumb
- pop_url
- product_description
- currency
- color
- size
- rating
- review
- material_composition
- style
- care_instructions
- feature
- images
- composition

Continued writing and testing XPaths for both PLP and PDP pages.
Validated XPath accuracy using browser developer tools.

Developed XPaths for PLP page elements:
PDP URLs, category names.
Initiated XPath development for PDP page fields.


Challenges Addressed:
- Dynamic content loading (AJAX).
- Varied product page structures.

Task Status: 
Task partially completed. PLP scraping successful, PDP extraction in progress.
