Overview:
Today's session focused on continuing the parser development with specific emphasis on data field mapping and extraction logic implementation. Significant progress was made in defining and mapping the target data fields from the website structure.


Parser Development Continuation:

- Continued implementation of parser methods for data extraction
- Developed field mapping strategies based on website structure
- Implemented core data extraction logic for essential fields
- Enhanced error handling for parsing operations

Daily Meeting:

- Discussed parser development progress and challenges

Data Field Mapping:

- Analyzed website structure to identify data field locations
- Mapped XPaths to target data fields
- Implemented extraction methods for complex field types

Tasks Status:
Parser Architecture: COMPLETED

Data Field Mapping: IN PROGRESS
- Core field extraction implemented
- Complex field mapping underway
