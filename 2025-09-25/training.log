Overview:
Today's session involved analyzing coding methodologies from recent implementations and beginning work on a new scraping task based on specific requirements. The day focused on requirement analysis and initial development of the crawler and parser.


Code Methodology Review:

- Analyzed architectural patterns from Billa site implementations
- Studied error handling strategies and data extraction optimizations
- Reviewed logging implementations and performance monitoring techniques

Daily Meeting:

- Received new task requirements and specifications
- Discussed project scope, target website, and data extraction needs
- Clarified technical requirements and delivery expectations


Requirement Analysis:

- Detailed analysis of the new task requirements
- Identified target website structure and data points
- Planned crawler architecture and parser implementation strategy

Initial Development:

-  Started crawler foundation with session management


Tasks status: In Progress

Requirement Analysis:
- Thorough understanding of new task specifications
- Target website structure analysis
- Data field mapping and extraction planning

Crawler Development: In Progress
