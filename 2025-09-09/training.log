Overview:
Today's focus was on practical implementation of Scrapy fundamentals to develop a robust web scraper for extracting product data from the Marks & Spencer e-commerce website. The session involved hands-on coding, debugging, and optimizing the spider.

Learning:
- Scrapy fundamentals (Spider creation, Item definition, Selector usage).

Task Implementation:
- Initiated development of a Scrapy spider for marksandspencer.com.
- Defined Items for structured data extraction:
- Product name, brand, price, category, URL, etc.
- Implemented spider logic to navigate PLP (Product Listing Pages) and PDP (Product Detail Pages).

Continued Development:

- Enhanced spider to handle:
- Pagination across PLP pages.
- HTTP requests with headers (User-Agent)
- Data extraction from PDP pages using XPath/CSS selectors.
- Tested and debugged the spider using Scrapy Shell.

Tasks:
- Scrapy Project Setup:
- Created Scrapy project structure (items.py, spiders/, pipelines.py).
- Spider Development:
- Built spider to crawl category pages and product URLs.
- Implemented parsing logic for both PLP and PDP pages.

Task Status:
- Scrapy project development almost complete.
