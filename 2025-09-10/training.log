Overview:
Today's focus was on completing the Scrapy web scraping task for Marks & Spencer and expanding knowledge of essential Python libraries for data processing, storage, and workflow automation. The session included code refinement, output generation, and exploration of key tools.


Task Completion:

- Finalized the Scrapy spider for marksandspencer.com.
- Enhanced data extraction logic to cover all required fields.

Daily Meeting:
- Discussed Scrapy task progress and reviewed new learning topics.

Learning Topics Explored:
Data Handling & Web Requests:
- requests: HTTP requests for APIs or simple scraping.
- parsel: HTML/XML parsing (alternative to Scrapy Selectors).
- re: Regular expressions for pattern matching and text cleaning.
- json: JSON serialization/deserialization.
- csv: CSV file read/write operations.
- xml/lxml: XML parsing and processing.
- urllib: URL handling and HTTP requests.
Database & Messaging:
- pymongo: MongoDB interaction for data storage.
- pika: RabbitMQ message queue integration.
Utilities & Workflow:
- logging: Application logging and debugging.
- datetime/time: Date/time manipulation and delays.
- ast: Literal evaluation of strings to Python objects.
- base64: Encoding/decoding data.
- os: Operating system interactions (file/directory management).
- random: Random data generation (e.g., User-Agent rotation).
- ftplib: FTP server communications.
Cloud & Advanced Tools:
- dropbox: Dropbox API integration.
- boto3: AWS services (S3, SQS, etc.).
- js2py: JavaScript execution in Python.
IPython: Interactive Python shell for debugging.
