                  Young Arthur spends his days toiling as a squire--feeding the horses and hauling his big brother's armor. Around him, England is in turmoil, left without a king. But all that changes in one day, with one pull on the mysterious sword in the stone. Guided by Merlin the Magician, Arthur takes his place as the rightful heir to England's throne. He receives the sword Excalibur and wins the loyalty of the Knights of the Round Table. But can the young king win peace and freedom for England?Type: Pre-loved

                  Young Arthur spends his days toiling as a squire--feeding the horses and hauling his big brother's armor. Around him, England is in turmoil, left without a king. But all that changes in one day, with one pull on the mysterious sword in the stone. Guided by Merlin the Magician, Arthur takes his place as the rightful heir to England's throne. He receives the sword Excalibur and wins the loyalty of the Knights of the Round Table. But can the young king win peace and freedom for England?Type: Pre-loved

Will they be her at home knickers - adorned with corgis - or her 'garden party' knickers, or perhaps her woolly Balmoral ones...?Type: Pre-loved

Will they be her at home knickers - adorned with corgis - or her 'garden party' knickers, or perhaps her woolly Balmoral ones...?Type: Pre-loved

You'll love Harvey - the busiest beaver in the world! Harvey has a new cupboard. ""What will you put in it?"" asks Chip. Harvey doesn't know but anyway it has to be painted first. ""What colour shall we paint it?"" asks Chip. Harvey doesn't know that either! ""Let's paint it with lots of different colours!"" says Chip. And so they do, with Chip becoming very messy and colourful himself along the way. Young readers will enjoy following Harvey and Chip's progress as the cupboard is transformed, and learning the practical details of basic decorating along the way. And the solution of what to put in it is very satisfying indeed! At the end of the book, there are step-by-step instructions for doing your own decorating and a colour mixing chart as well.

                  Oxford Reading Tree remains the nation's favourite reading scheme and countless children have learnt to read with Biff, Chip, and Kipper. We are delighted to unveil its fresh new look for today's children, teachers and parents, with lively new covers and fresh artwork. Engaging new artwork and covers Alex Brychta's unique style of artwork enthrals and entertains children, and the fresh new look will heighten their pleasure in reading the stories. With freshly drawn artwork for all the favourite core stories at Stages 2 - 5 and fantastic new covers, Oxford Reading Tree is more appealing than ever! Stories children love The Oxford Reading Tree stories have always captivated children's imagination, inspiring them to read - and the stories and characters in the new editions haven't changed at all. Apart, that is, from an exciting new story at Stage 3, The Egg Hunt, which replaces the Dolphin Pool. Simplified structure We have also simplified the structure of the scheme in response to feedback from you: Owls Storybooks become Stages 6 and 7 Storybooks; magpies become Stages 8 and 9 Storybooks; wrens at Stage 2 have become patterned stories at Stage 1+; and wrens at Stage 3 are now patterned stories at Stage 2. New teaching support material In addition to the existing guided reading cards, perfect for use in guided reading sessions, we have brought out new teaching materials to reflect the needs of teachers in today's classroom: · Flexible, friendly teacher's notes included FREE with each pack of Oxford Reading Tree books - these are easy to store and will save you hours of preparation! · New Take-Home cards for every Storybook from Stages 1 - 9 to help parents or carers get the most out of reading with their child · Free resources website at www.oup.com/uk/primary with downloadable photocopy masters · New Teacher's Handbook and special edition for ScotlandType: Pre-loved

                  When the Knight Bus crashes through the darkness and screeches to a halt in front of him, it's the start of another far from ordinary year at Hogwarts for Harry Potter. Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort, is on the run - and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves . But perhaps most terrifying of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking kiss. These new editions of the classic and internationally bestselling, multi-award-winning series feature instantly pick-up-able new jackets by Jonny Duddle, with huge child appeal, to bring Harry Potter to the next generation of readers. It's time to PASS THE MAGIC ON .
